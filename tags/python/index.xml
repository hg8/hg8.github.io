      <description>Craft was a not so straight forward box, mainly based on little configuration mistakes rather than exploits. Which makes it more interesting in my opinion. I learned a few tricks on this one.
First thing first, let&#39;s add the box IP to the hosts file:
$ echo &amp;#34;10.10.10.110 craft.htb&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/hosts and let&#39;s start!
User Flag Recon Let&#39;s start with the classic nmap scan:
$ nmap -sV -sT -sC craft.htb Starting Nmap 7.</description>

      <description>Jarvis was a pretty straight forward box and &amp;ldquo;textbook case&amp;rdquo; style. While it&#39;s rated as Medium difficulty I would advise beginners to start with this one.
It rely on bad configurations practices rather than already made exploits which makes it more interesting in my opinion.
First thing first, let&#39;s add the box IP to the hosts file:
$ echo &amp;#34;10.10.10.143 jarvis.htb&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/hosts Let&#39;s go !
