      <description>Table of contents    User Flag  Recon Pivot www-data -&amp;gt; jimmy Pivot jimmy -&amp;gt; joanna   Root Flag  Recon Exploit nano SUID      OpenAdmin is an easy Linux based box, it need a bit of exploit, lot of recon, pivot and a bit GTFObins to finish, nice combo right? While this box is rated easy I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend it for beginners since it require a lot a recon, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to miss important information and can be very frustrating if you are not used to it.</description>

      <title>Registry - HackTheBox</title>

      <description>Registry was my first hard box, this box was pretty interesting with real-life scenario like I love. This box shows the importance of understanding how things works &amp;ldquo;behind the scene&amp;rdquo; and to read all documentations carefully to not miss anything. I recommend this box for people who finished few medium difficulty boxes and wants to level-up.
Tl;Dr: The user flag consisted in finding an INSTALL archive containing install instruction and certificate to deploy an online docker registry, this certificate was used on the docker registry running on the box.</description>
