      <description>Table of contents    User Flag  Recon NoSQL Injection Blind NoSQL data extract Pivot mango -&amp;gt; admin   Root Flag  Recon jjs setuid exploitation       Mango just retired on HackTheBox, it was an Medium rated Linux box. As usual I really liked the whole exploration process especially the custom exploitation part and learned a bit about Mongodb. I know I say this every-time but this box is my favorite box so far.</description>

      <description>Traverxec was in my opinion a particular and interesting box. While being rated easy it still teach me a little trick and got me very frustrated at some point because it was super easy to overlook and overthink easy things. Still it was worth cogitate on it!
Tl;Dr: The user flag was accessible after using a Remote Code Execution exploit on the nhttpd web server running, giving us access to the www-data user.</description>

While this box is rated easy I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend it for beginners since it require a lot a recon, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to miss important information and can be very frustrating if you are not used to it.</description>

      <description>Jarvis was a pretty straight forward box and &amp;ldquo;textbook case&amp;rdquo; style. While it&amp;rsquo;s rated as Medium difficulty I would advise beginners to start with this one.
It rely on bad configurations practices rather than already made exploits which makes it more interesting in my opinion.
First thing first, let&amp;rsquo;s add the box IP to the hosts file:
[hg8@archbook ~]$ echo &amp;#34;10.10.10.143 jarvis.htb&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/hosts Let&amp;rsquo;s go !
User Flag Recon Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the classic nmap scan:</description>
