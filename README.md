I set up this website to keep notes of my various work and especially CTF writeups.  
Iâ€™m writing all of this down for mainly three purposes:

- Share it with you.
- Systematize it for future reference and improvement.
- Learn from your feedback.

Your questions and observations are welcome!

Feel free to drop me a message on twitter ([@\_hg8\_](https://twitter.com/_hg8_)) or to my email:

hello at hg8 dot sh

Cheers!
