      <title>Craft - HackTheBox</title>

      <description>Craft was a not so straight forward box, mainly based on little configuration mistakes rather than exploits. Which makes it more interesting in my opinion. I learned a few tricks on this one.
First thing first, let&#39;s add the box IP to the hosts file:
$ echo &amp;#34;10.10.10.110 craft.htb&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/hosts and let&#39;s start!
User Flag Recon Let&#39;s start with the classic nmap scan:
$ nmap -sV -sT -sC craft.htb Starting Nmap 7.</description>

      <description>Wall was an interresting box, exploit oriented. The initial foothold was not straight forward to find and took a bit of time to finally figure out.
First thing first, let&#39;s add the box IP to the hosts file:
$ echo &amp;#34;10.10.10.157 wall.htb&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/hosts and let&#39;s start!
User Flag Recon Let&#39;s start with the classic nmap scan:
$ nmap -sV -sT -sC wall.htb Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-10-28 16:25 CET Nmap scan report for wall.</description>

      <description>Jarvis was a pretty straight forward box and &amp;ldquo;textbook case&amp;rdquo; style. While it&#39;s rated as Medium difficulty I would advise beginners to start with this one.
It rely on bad configurations practices rather than already made exploits which makes it more interesting in my opinion.
First thing first, let&#39;s add the box IP to the hosts file:
$ echo &amp;#34;10.10.10.143 jarvis.htb&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/hosts Let&#39;s go !

      <description>Networking was an interesting box. Focused on coding mistakes rather than exploit or misconfiguration.
First thing first, let&#39;s add the box IP to the hosts file:
$ echo &amp;#34;10.10.10.146 networked.htb&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/hosts Let&#39;s go !
User Flag Recon Let&#39;s start with the classic nmap scan:

      <description>Haystack is a very interesting box to learn more about the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack which is becoming very popular. The user part is very CTF type while the root part is more realistic scenario.
First thing first, let&#39;s add the box IP to the hosts file:
echo &amp;#39;10.10.10.115 haystack.htb&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/hosts User Flag Recon Let&#39;s start with the classic nmap scan:

      <description>Writeup was my first machine I solved to start my CTF journey. It&#39;s an easy rated box but still interesting and perfect to jump into the CTF bath!
User Flag Recon Let&#39;s start with the classic nmap:
